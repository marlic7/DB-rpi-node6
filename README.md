# Minimalistic docker image with Node.js 6 for Raspberry Pi 3

This is own build based on: https://github.com/hypriot/rpi-node/raw/master/6.10/alpine/Dockerfile but without Yarn as origin build (I don't need it).

Build image:
```bash
DOCKER_REG_URL=docker_user_name_or_private_repo_domain ./build.sh
```
